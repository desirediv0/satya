                    The Foreign Manufacturers Certification Scheme (FMCS) is
                    tailored for manufacturers out of India who wish to export
                    their products to the Indian market. Foreign manufacturers
                    can apply for BIS certification through an Authorized Indian
                    Representative (AIR) or by establishing their own
                    representative office in India. FMCS certification
                    facilitates international trade by ensuring that imported
                    products meet Indian standards, improving consumer safety
                    and protecting national interests. It smoothens the process
                    for foreign manufacturers to certify their products in line
                    with Indian regulations.{" "}

                    FMCS (ISI Mark) is a Scheme operated by the Bureau of Indian
                    Standards since year 2000 under Scheme-I of Schedule-II, BIS
                    Act, 2016 and (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018 for
                    foreign manufacturers. This scheme enables the overseas
                    applicants/manufacturers to use the standard mark, which is
                    also called ISI Mark, to sell their products in India. The
                    foreign manufacturers Certification Department (FMCD) is the
                    only eligible authority that can grant BIS Certificate for
                    import to the foreign manufacturers. The major motive of BIS
                    for granting a Manufacturing certificate to Foreign
                    manufactures is that the public gets good quality, safe,
                    reliable and risk-free products.{" "}

                    BIS FMCS Certificate in India from the FMCD department is
                    meant for the manufacturing units located overseas, which
                    will undergo for factory audit to determine whether the
                    manufacturer is complying with all the necessary
                    requirements illustrated by BIS. ISI Mark under Foreign
                    Manufacturers Certification Scheme is issued by FMCD since
                    2000. BIS Standard Mark or ISI Mark consists of Licence
                    number as &apos;CM/L-XXXXXXXXXX&apos; at the bottom of ISI
                    Mark and Indian standard number at the top of above ISI
                    Mark. This mark shall be rewarded by the Bureau of Indian
                    Standards after the successful grant of the BIS Certificate.
