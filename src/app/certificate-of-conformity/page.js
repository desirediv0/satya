                    The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) began issuing
                    Certificates of Conformity in accordance with Scheme-IV of
                    Schedule II of the BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulation,
                    2018. The Bureau may issue a Certificate of Conformity (CoC)
                    for goods and articles (products) that are manufactured in
                    accordance with the specifications outlined in the relevant
                    Indian Standards. A Certificate of Conformity from BIS is
                    necessary for every manufacturer of a product covered by a
                    CoC. Each product covered by mandatory CoC must be marked
                    with the CoC Number. All CoC-covered products must be
                    manufactured using BIS Standard-marked (ISI Marked)
                    materials. Due to several factors such as national security,
                    public interest, the prevention of unfair trade practices,
                    etc., the government has made a number of products subject
                    to mandatory compliance with Indian Standards through
                    Quality Control Orders.{" "}
